# Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Setup Tool
  
A tool to configure what maps to load with the game, and enable fast multiplayer bootup.
More features might be added as dev work goes forward.

Current version automatically detects your install path if it's the Steam version, otherwise you have to manually set it. Once it's set you can disable maps, apply the changes and press launch.
